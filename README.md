# SBM-MCMC

This is an implementation and application of the theoretical work by Emmanuel Abbe ([Community detection and stochastic block models: Recent developments](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-480/16-480.pdf)) and the algorithmic work by Peter Chin, Anup Rao, and Van Vu ([Stochastic block model and community detection in the sparse graphs: A spectral algorithm with optimal rate of recovery](http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v40/Chin15.pdf)) and Tiago P. Peixoto's tool [graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de)

You can play with it by 
```
bash run.sh
```

Hopefully you will get both MNI scores and the visulation of partation results of both full Division IA team network (clear data) and conference based Division IA team network.
